== Build Instructions

=== Requirement

JDK 1.8

NOTE: You should use our maven wrapper (`./mvnw`) script to
get a more consistent build result. It should auto
download the correct version of Maven tool if you do not already
have one.


=== To compile:
----
export JAVA_HOME=/path/to/jdk8
./mvnw compile
----


=== To build distribution package

----
./mvnw package

# Or if you want to skip tests
./mvnw package -DskipTests
----

NOTE: The final combined single jar is found under `quartz/target/quartz-<version>.jar`
